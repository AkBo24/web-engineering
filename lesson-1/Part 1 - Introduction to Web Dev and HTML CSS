## 1. Web Development Overview

##### What is Web Development

Web developers build and maintain websites, often working for clients to get their product or service online.

These developers build everything from a scoped to-do app to highly-complex and large-scale applications like a Health Care management system.

The work involves front-end, back-end, or full-stack development and is project-focused, requiring collaboration with a team.

##### Types of Web Developers

Web applications are generally split into two parts

1. **Front End**: The GUI (graphical user interface) where users like you and me interact on a browser
    - Uses HTML/CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby on Rails etc
2. **Back End**: The data that powers the frontend
    - focuses on server-side logic, database interactions and application architecture
    - Languages: Java, Python, Ruby, JS

Developers focus on either the front end or backend or both (called a Fullstack developer)!

##### The Learning Journey

-   Web development is rewarding but can be challenging.
-   Success in the field often depends on what you can build and demonstrate, rather than formal education or background.
-   Continuous learning and adapting are crucial.

Throughout this course you'll learn many different tools and programming languages

-   Command Line Interfaces
-   Git/Github
-   HTML/CSS, JS, Rust
-   most importantly I'll impart the confidence to teach yourselves any programming skill you want to learn

## 2. Basics of HTML (15 minutes)

##### What are HTML and CSS

HTML and CSS are the two languages that power what you see and how they are styled on a webpage

-   **HTML** is the raw data that a webpage displays (text, links, lists etc)
-   **CSS** styles the HTML content (gives color, font, size etc)

Caveat: HTML & CSS are not programming languages; JavaScript is the programming language that provides the logic for websites to do things
